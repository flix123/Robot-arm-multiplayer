# Purpose of this repository

This repository does not contain a complete project, but a sub-problem. It is intended for further training and is not simply meant to be solved, but to convey an understanding of how it works. 
The aim of this scene in Unity is to control a robot arm in a multiplayer application with several participants. 
In addition, all executed actions should be synchronized with the other participating clients. 
Only one participant at a time should be able to control the arm. 
The robot arm and the code are from the demo repository of Unity itself (see https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/articulations-robot-demo), only slightly modified.
